# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Preferred**: Use GitHub’s **“Report a vulnerability”** (Security Advisories) for this repository.
- **Alternate**: Email **security@onspec.solutions** with details (steps to reproduce, impact, affected versions/commit).

Please avoid posting sensitive details in public issues or PRs.

## Disclosure & Timelines

- **Acknowledge receipt** of your report within **7 days**.
- **Target fix/patch** within **90 days**, sooner for high-severity issues.
- We may request coordination on public disclosure to protect downstream users.

## Scope

Reports are in scope if they demonstrate a security impact in this repository’s code or build/release artifacts (e.g., RCE, privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure, supply-chain concerns). Social engineering and purely theoretical issues without a plausible exploit path are typically out of scope.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, non-disruptive research that:
- Respects privacy and does not exfiltrate more data than necessary for proof.
- Avoids service degradation or data destruction.
- Respects rate limits and only tests against your own instances/environments unless explicitly authorized.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
