# Funding & Transparency

**HostBridge** is donation-ware: free to use, no paywalls, no feature gates.  
If it helps you ship, consider funding ongoing maintenance and improvements.

## How to Contribute
- GitHub Sponsor button on the repo header (if enabled), or
- Open Collective (transparent budget), or
- Direct support via our listed links in `.github/FUNDING.yml`.

> **Links:** See the **Sponsor** button on this repository, or the Funding section in the README.

## Our “Bucket Is Full” Rule
We set clear goals and caps. When the current funding goal is met:
- We **pause additional intake** (“bucket is full”) until we publish a new goal and plan.
- Excess funds are **not** stockpiled. We either:
  - reduce/pause acceptance, or
  - roll over with an explicitly published scope (roadmap items, maintenance commitments, or community grants).

## What Funds Cover
- **Maintenance & Support**: triage, bugfixes, docs, releases.
- **Engineering Time**: refactors, quality gates, CI hardening, analyzers, samples.
- **Security & Compliance**: dependency updates, security audits/tooling.
- **Operational Costs**: CI minutes, signing, hosting for docs/artifacts (if any).

We do **not** sell user data or introduce telemetry that phones home by default.

## Tiers (Guidance, not a paywall)
- **$5 – Supporter**: A thank-you in release notes’ wall of supporters.
- **$20 – Sustainer**: Vote on docs/examples priorities (issues tagged `community-vote`).
- **$100 – Backer**: Eligible for quarterly office hours (limited slots; first-come).
- **$250+ – Company**: Logo in README “Backers” section + transparency report line item.

> Perks don’t buy influence over technical direction or security posture. They help prioritize *eligible* community work.

## Reporting & Ledger
- If using **Open Collective**, all transactions are public.
- Otherwise, we publish a simple funding summary per release or quarterly in this repo.
